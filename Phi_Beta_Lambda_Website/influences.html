<!--Intro to the topic-->
<h1>Our Influences</h1>
<p>Humans are the smartest living organisms on planet earth. So what we do to our environment has a big impact on not just us but on all the ecosystems and its habitants. And for years and years the physical impact that we made in our environment has led to many chaotic situations.<br>Humans impact the physical environment in many ways: overpopulation, pollution, burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. Changes like these have triggered climate change, soil erosion, poor air quality, and undrinkable water. These negative impacts can affect human behavior and can prompt mass migrations or battles over clean water. And in the worst case scenario it may lead to the extinction of our ecosystems and its habitants.<br>The impacts can be described as below:</p>
<ul>

    </div> 
  <li><h3>Pollution</h3><p>&emsp;Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.<br>Pollution is a global problem. Although urban areas are usually more polluted than the countryside, pollution can spread to remote places where no people live. For example, pesticides and other chemicals have been found in the Antarctic ice sheet. In the middle of the northern Pacific Ocean, a huge collection of microscopic plastic particles forms what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/pollution/#:~:text=The%20three%20major%20types%20of,water%20pollution%2C%20and%20land%20pollution.&text=Sometimes%2C%20air%20pollution%20is%20visible,however%2C%20air%20pollution%20is%20invisible" style="color:blue"><i>Click here for more information.</i></a></p></li></div>

    </div> 
  <li><h3>Deforestation</h3><p>&emsp;Forests cover 31% of the land area on our planet. They help people thrive and survive by, for example, purifying water and air and providing people with jobs; some 13.2 million people across the world have a job in the forest sector and another 41 million have a job that is related to the sector. Many animals also rely on forests. Eighty percent of the world's land-based species, such as elephants and rhinos, live in forests. Forests also play a critical role in mitigating climate change because they act as a carbon sink—soaking up carbon dioxide that would otherwise be free in the atmosphere and contribute to ongoing changes in climate patterns.<br>Deforestation is a particular concern in tropical rain forests because these forests are home to much of the world’s biodiversity. For example, in the Amazon around 17% of the forest has been lost in the last 50 years, mostly due to forest conversion for cattle ranching. Deforestation in this region is particularly rampant near more populated areas, roads and rivers, but even remote areas have been encroached upon when valuable mahogany, gold, and oil are discovered.<a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/deforestation-and-forest-degradation" style="color:blue"><i>Click here for more information.</i></a></p></li></div>

    </div> 
  <li><h3>Degradation of ecosystems</h3><p>&emsp;The degradation of ecosystems is an environmental problem that diminishes the capacity of species to survive. This degradation occurs in different ways and is manifested in a reduction in the richness of the ecosystems as well as their biological diversity, and in the goods and services they can offer, thereby affecting indigenous and/or migratory species. The degradation of ecosystems due to overexploitation of their resources, though serving a short-term economic goal, has had direct negative effects on social welfare in the medium and long terms. As long as the ecosystem is not degraded, it represents a source of wealth for society, hence the importance of keeping it in good condition.<a href="http://www.oas.org/sanjuan/english/documents/tda/information/ecosystem.html#:~:text=The%20degradation%20of%20ecosystems%20is,capacity%20of%20species%20to%20survive.&text=The%20degradation%20of%20ecosystems%20due,the%20medium%20and%20long%20terms" style="color:blue"><i>Click here for more information.</i></a></p></li></div>

    </div> 
  <li><h3>Depletion of natural resources</h3><p>&emsp;The depletion of natural resources occurs when resources are consumed at a faster rate than that of replacement. Natural resources are those resources that are in existence without human actions and they can either be renewable or non-renewable. And when it gets down to the discussion of natural resource depletion, it a terminology used in reference to water usage, farming, fossil fuel consumption, fishing, and mining. And above all, natural resource depletion is defined on the premise that the value of a resource is measured in terms of its availability in nature.<br>The main reasons for the depletion of natural resources can be listed a below:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Over Population</li>
    <li>Poor Farming Practices</li>
    <li>Logging</li>
    <li>Overconsumption of Natural Resources</li>
    <li>Industrial and Technological Development</li>
  </ol>
