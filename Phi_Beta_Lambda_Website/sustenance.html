<h1>Environmental Sustainability</h1>
<p>In the charter for the UCLA Sustainability Committee, sustainability is defined as: “the integration of environmental health, social equity and economic vitality in order to create thriving, healthy, diverse and resilient communities for this generation and generations to come. The practice of sustainability recognizes how these issues are interconnected and requires a systems approach and an acknowledgement of complexity.”<br>So Environmental sustainability can be defined as the responsibility to conserve natural resources and protect global ecosystems to support health and wellbeing, now and in the future. Because so many decisions that impact the environment are not felt immediately, a key element of environmental sustainability is its forward-looking nature. In fact, the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/sustainability-and-roe" style="color: blue;">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> defines it as “meeting today’s needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.” Some ways to achieve environmental sustainability can be listed as below.</p>

  <li><h3>Renewable Energy</h3><p>&emsp;Renewable energy is useful energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, including carbon neutral sources like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.<br>Renewable energy can play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using renewable energy can reduce the use of fossil fuels.<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/renewable-sources/" style="color: blue;">Click here to know more about renewable energy.</a></p></li></div>

  <li><h3>Tax incentives for environmentally sensible practices</h3><p>&emsp; Tax incentives are ways of reducing taxes for businesses and individuals in exchange for specific desirable actions or investments on their parts. Green building (using environmentally friendly techniques and materials), the purchase and installation of anti-pollution equipment, the use of alternative energy, energy conservation, environmentally sensitive development, research into environmentally friendly industrial processes – all of these and more can be made more attractive and feasible for businesses and individuals through the offer of tax incentives.<br>By reducing the taxes on environmentally sensible practices we can encourage communities and its people to GO GREEN.<a href="https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/implement/changing-policies/tax-incentives/main" style="color:blue"><i>Click here for more information.</i></a></p></li></div>

  <li><h3>Cradle to Cradle responsibility</h3><p>&emsp;Cradle to cradle can be defined as the design and production of products of all types in such a way that at the end of their life, they can be truly recycled (upcycled), imitating nature’s cycle with everything either recycled or returned to the earth, directly or indirectly through food, as a completely safe, nontoxic, and biodegradable nutrient. With cradle to cradle, all the components of a product feed another product, the earth or animal, or become fuel: products are composed of either materials that biodegrade and become food for biological cycles or of technical materials that stay in closed-loop technical cycles, continually circulating as valuable nutrients for industry. It could be argued that cradle to cradle is equivalent to true sustainability – through the biological or technical components used, all products become sustainable as nothing becomes waste which cannot be reused.<a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-642-28036-8_165" style="color:blue"><i>Click here for more information.</i></a></p></li></div>

    <li><h3>Education for sustainability</h3><p>&emsp;It has become our necessity to aware our upcoming generation about their responsibilities towards the environment. And the best way to do so is by including the idea of <i>sustainability</i> in their cirriculum.<br>Sustainability education encompasses all school subjects and extends far beyond the classroom. It gives students real-world skills they can use to improve the planet. It provides today’s children with the self-sufficiency they need for tomorrow. It offers them a deeply engraved understanding of why the environment is important.<br>Here’s what sustainability education teaches students — and why educational environments should make it a priority<a href="https://www.spark-y.org/blog/2019/11/18/why-sustainable-education-is-crucial-for-the-next-generation" style="color: blue;"><i>Click here for more information</i></a></p></li></div>
